Using netcat (nc) is going to be pretty important. Can you connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org at port 25103 to get the flag?

Open up the terminal and type the following command.

```shell
nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 25103
```

You've got the flag. If you want to learn more about nc type the following command to the terminal.

```shell
man nc
```
