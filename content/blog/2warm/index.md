Can you convert the number 42 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

Every decimal number has a representation in a binary form. For example, take the number 3, which is in the decimal format. In the binary form it is equal to '11'.

If you want to learn about this, I recommend look at the table below.

```python
print(bin(42)[2:])
```

The program above converts the decimal number '42' to it's binary representation. Nice, you've got the flag!
